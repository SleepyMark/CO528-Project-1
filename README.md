> ##### V2
> - Added selection operators into the design
>    - Champion function  $champ = N/2$
>    - Random selection function  $ran = N/4$
>    - Crossover function  $cross = N/4$
>    - Mutate All function
> - Decreased iterations from 1000 to 25
>  <u>Points:</u>
>  - After iteration 20, fitness decreases exponentially
>  - Runtime takes majorly long
>  - Fitness is 10 times smaller than V1
